# Software Development Team Health Check

My question deck - inspired by Spotify’s Team Health Check.

## Recognising problems and opportunities

Our apps are finely instrumented feedback machines and we regularly engage with clients in ways that uncover their issues and provide insights into how to improve the product and their experience!
Our approach is systemised and catches important problems and opportunities. We use data to back up observations and occasionally find correlations.
We usually reference behaviours we’ve seen from clients when justifying what’s in the backlog
There are some clear ways to get better at finding legitimate problems and opportunities
I don’t buy into what we choose to do. I have no confidence that solving most of these problems will make a difference


## Backlog Accessibility

Our backlog is a masterpiece with the clarity of Orwell and the expression of Da Vinci
Everything we’re doing and everything we’re planning is in one place, which is great
I find it pretty useful
It’s messy - but if I grit my teeth it’s worth it
It’s worse than if we ditched it entirely


## Exploring solutions

We examine every angle, think outside the box and use our full potential to imagine and collaboratively zone-in on high impact solutions
We imagine effective options and pick things the team is confident will work
We explore solutions and make progress
We are generally derivative and are often more focused on getting started than backing what we believe in
Who makes this stuff up?


## Value Prediction/Prioritisation

We perform intricate value modelling backed by historic delivery data and direct client insights to effectively reduce cost of delay
I understand and buy-in to the way we assess the value of changes to support appropriate prioritisation
Our value predictions and prioritisation likely have a positive impact on our products
We probably get it right occasionally but it’s mostly guess work
We don’t put any worthwhile thought into this


## Product Innovation

Steve Jobs thinks we’re denting the universe!
We take calculated risks, learn and occasionally win big
Sometimes we do something I think is cool
We’re don’t really do innovation
Concepts I buy into often disappear without explanation and there’s no clear way I can test any of my own ideas, even if I spent time on it out of work


## Engineering Quality

Our codebases and deployment pipelines are bleeding edge, allowing us to make ‘crazy fast’ changes reliably
We use modern tools and best practices. Changes are as fast considering the scale of our operation
We seem to get stuff done and don’t cause too many bugs
Stakeholders sometimes grumble that things take a while and clients experience a few too many issues to fully trust the platform
It takes months to do something useful. Bug hell!


## Continuous Delivery/Releasing changes

It’s instant and invisible. I commit code and get back to sipping my Margareta
We’re super slick at getting things to clients as soon as we’re happy features are ready and can easily rollback problems
Our QA and release queues are manageable
Which release trains need me to merge this bug fix?
I wonder if we’ll have released this change by Christmas


## Validating Progress

Our successes are clear enough to celebrate and our failures provide valuable insights
We can point to charts and statistically prove progress
There are sometimes signs that indicate we’ve made things better
We rarely consider this seriously
We may often make things worse - no-one really cares to check


## Continuous Improvement

Measurable improvement is a natural consequence of our working culture and everything we do
We can demonstrate improvement and innovate our processes to strive for better
Over time I believe we improve
I don’t see any signs of improvement
We’re stagnating and no one cares. It’s getting me down


## Team Spirit

We have better chemistry than Kirk and Spock. We’re the bloody A-team
We have fun doing what we love together
Everyone gets on well enough to do a good job
There is some friction at times that isn’t useful to the process
Kill me now
